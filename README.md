# Automatic File Organizer üóÇÔ∏è

A Python script to automatically sort files in a directory into subfolders based on their extensions. Say goodbye to cluttered folders!
I personally use this after photo and videoshoots to automatically sort raw/jpg and video files


## Features
- Scans a directory for files.
- Creates subfolders for each file type (e.g., "Images" for .jpg, .png).
- Moves files into the appropriate folders.
- Ignores directories and hidden files.
- Customizable extensions and folder names.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/kaygaaf/file-organizer-py`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd file-organizer-py`

## Usage
Run the script with a directory path:
```bash
python organizer.py /path/to/your/directory
