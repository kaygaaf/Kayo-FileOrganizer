A Python script to automatically sort files in a directory into subfolders based on their extensions. Say goodbye to cluttered folders!
I personally use this after photo and videoshoots to automatically sort raw/jpg and video files

- Moves files into the appropriate folders.
- Ignores directories and hidden files.
- Customizable extensions and folder names.

Edit the extension_map dictionary in organizer.py to group extensions (e.g., combine .jpg and .png into "Images").
