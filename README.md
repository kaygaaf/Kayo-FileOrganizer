# Automatic File Organizer üóÇÔ∏è

A Python script to automatically sort files in a directory into subfolders based on their extensions. Say goodbye to cluttered folders!
I personally use this after photo and videoshoots to automatically sort raw/jpg and video files by letting it auto run when connecting the SD card.

## Features
- Scans a directory for files.
- Creates subfolders for each file type (e.g., "Images" for .jpg, .png).
- Moves files into the appropriate folders.
- Ignores directories and hidden files.
- Customizable extensions and folder names.

## Usage
Edit the extension_map dictionary in Kayo-FileOrganizer.py to group extensions (e.g., combine .jpg and .png into "Images").
